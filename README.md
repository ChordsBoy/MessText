# MessText
The code for messtext.com lol

Keep in mind, none of this works out of the box. You need PHP, ffmpeg, a web server, and a domain with Cloudflare, and you have to edit the server paths in multiple pages in order to host this on your own.
I slightly edited the code so that you don't need my exact directory structure to host it, but still, you have to edit paths in a lot of places xd

Also, keep in mind that I'm about 75% better at programming than this these days. I just don't feel like updating the code for this site lol
